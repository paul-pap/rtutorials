#' Annual Averages of Fall Color by Species
#'
#' Daily percentage of fall tree color in Mount Mansfield State Forest,
#' Vermont 1991 to 2021 (days 246 - 310 each year).
#' Annual measurements of fall color to establish the timing of developmental
#' events and trends, as a measure of forest condition (ie effects of stress
#' events) and long-term changes (i.e. effects of global climate change).

#' @details
#' The heat syndrome is identified in surveillance data by looking for diagnostic codes for heat-related illness and by searching chief complaints (descriptions of why patients are at the ED) for words related to heat, such as overheating, sunstroke, and similar terms.
#'
#' Syndrome data are inherently non-specific and are not based on diagnostic testing. While the NYC syndromic surveillance system captures data on 100% of ED visits in the city (as of 5/1/16), the data are not comprehensive because some residents seek care outside the city. These data are not exact measures and should be used to understand trends, rather than to count cases. In addition, recent data are not final and are subject to change.
#'
#' Tracking heat-related illness (HRI) in near-real time can help provide situational awareness, supplementing the weather forecast as an indicator of public health risk. HRI detected in emergency department syndromic surveillance data are strongly associated with hot weather and highly correlated with daily counts of HRI hospital discharge data. However, HRI counts detected in the ED syndromic surveillance data represent suspected rather than confirmed illness and is useful to track trends. Some records may be counted as cases when they are not HRI, while other HRI cases may go undetected due to differences in hospital coding practices or because of what patients say when they describe what is bothering them.
